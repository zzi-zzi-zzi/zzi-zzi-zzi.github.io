# Schedule Tab
This tab contains the settings related to Unspoiled items.

## Schedule
Set wich item you want Mew to gather for each hour and if you want it to be gathered as collectabble.

If set to "None", it'll then use other mode with lower priority.

If set to "Rest", it'll litterally do nothing and just wait during a specific hour.

Important, having multiple items inw a row make cause GP issues and Mew could then skip some of them. Also all ARR items are avaiable during a 3H windows but can be gathered only 1 time so don't set the same item more than once or you'll just waste an hour.
		

## Wait at the Aetheryte and not at the hotspot
If Enable, it'll wait for the node after teleporting

 * Instead of "Teleport -> Move to the hotspot -> Wait untill spawn -> Search & Go for it" .
 * It'll now "Teleport -> Wait untill spawn -> Move to the hotspot -> Search & Go for it".
	
## Away while resting
If Enable, it'll use /away during resting time and remove it at the end. Important if you stop and start it while your character is away the "away" icon will be disable and re enable when the rest time is done.
	
## Teleport Delay

### Before
You can set the time (Eorzean minutes) you want it to teleport before an unspoiled node.
		

### After
You can set the time (Seconds) you want it to wait before teleport after an unspoiled node.
	
## Revenant's Toll
You need to have MIN/BOT Cluster 1/2/3 (wichever you want) set in the schedule.

Set the amount of Revenant's Toll items you want to have. Important, if there isn't Dark Matter Cluster or Unsapected Crystal and if all amounts are reached it'll gather what's set as Alternative item.
